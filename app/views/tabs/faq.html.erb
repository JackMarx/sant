                <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-1"> How long does it take the infusion process take?</a>

                <div id="accordion-1" class="accordion-section-content">
                    <p>The infusion speed depends on the temperature of the water and the moisture content of the fruit. When it comes to temperature, the warmer the water the faster the infusion. With hot water, the fruit starts to infuse right away. With temperate water, the fruit generally starts to infuse within a few minutes and continues infusing for hours. For a cold beverage it can take a while, so you can keep a pitcher infusing in the fridge, start the infusion hours before you want to drink it (or even over night), or make it with hot water and then add ice.</p>

                    <p>As for the moisture content, it varies since the fruit is organic and sun-dried. We try to tell the earth elements to be exactly the same everywhere we grow and the sun to emit the exact same temperature when we dry. We are continually working on finding the optimal moisture content that allows for the quickest infusion, but still is dry enough to naturally preserve the fruit.</p>
                    <p>To get a stronger flavor quicker you can add more fruit in the beginning and then keep reusing it until it stops releasing color.

                <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-2">How do I make the fruit infusions with Garcinia indica?</a>

                <div id="accordion-2" class="accordion-section-content">
                    <p>There isn&rsquo;t a right or wrong way to make an infusion; you make it your way. Experiment with different amounts of fruit and different infusion times to find the method and flavor that suits you. If you end up with a flavor that&rsquo;s too strong for you, don&rsquo;t worry just add more water. If the flavor isn&rsquo;t strong enough, you guessed it, add more fruit. Try around 4 pieces for a more subtle flavor and 8 -12 pieces for a stronger flavor (per 12 oz). To get a stronger flavor quicker you can add more fruit in the beginning and then keep reusing it until it stops releasing color.</p>
                    <p>

                        Another approach is to make a concentrate and add a little bit of the liquid to a glass of water or to keep a pitcher infusing in your fridge. Or pop pieces in your water bottle in the morning and enjoy throughout the day. You can get creative too - add ingredients, make hot fruit teas, organic sodas, smoothies or cocktails. The fruit is versatile. The options are endless. Check out our recipes section for ideas.</p>

                <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-3">What does the fruit infusion taste like?</a>

                <div id="accordion-3" class="accordion-section-content">
                    <p>Sant&rsquo;s do-it-yourself style lets you customize the flavor. The exact flavor varies depending on how strong the infusion is. Color is a good indicator of flavor. When it is a light infusion, (a light pink color) it&rsquo;s close to a rose flavor. When it is stronger, it is most similar to hibiscus, cranberry and tamarind. The flavor intensifies by adding more fruit or more time for the fruit to infuse. The fruit infusions are consistently described as refreshing. The flavor is tart with a hint of sweetness. For a sweet option, add brown sugar or honey. The fruit mixes well with other ingredients too. Get your mixologist on and create some recipes.</p>
