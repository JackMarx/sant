      <p>Please refer to our Privacy Policy (<%= link_to("www.aloha.com/privacy", "http://www.idrinksant.com") %>) for information on how we collect, use and disclose information from our users.</p>
       
      <h2>Free Trial</h2>

      <p>You can receive one free trial containing pouches/samples of Sant’s products that allow you to try them before enrolling in a monthly or bi-monthly service.  Trials are free, but there is a shipping and handling fee of either $1.80.</p>
       
      <p>When you receive your Free Trial, you will also receive a fourteen (14) day trial membership with Sant, which begins the date that the trial is purchased. If you enjoy your Free Trial and do not cancel or customize your trial membership within 14 days from the date the trial was purchased, we will automatically enroll you in a monthly service and will charge your credit card. </p>
       
      <h2>Monthly Service</h2>

      <p>After you receive your Free Trial, and if you don’t cancel your monthly service within fourteen (14) days, you will automatically be enrolled in a monthly service. This first order will bill and ship out on the fourteenth (14th) day of your trial, and default to every thirty (30) days thereafter.  At any time, you may log onto your account and customize your monthly service.  If you do not update your selection for a particular month, we will send you the same shipment as we sent the previous month, subject to availability.</p>
       
      <p>At any time during your monthly service, you may alter the products you receive, as well as the frequency you will receive those products, by visiting the Sant website or by contacting Sant at <%= mail_to "balance@idrinksant.com" %>.  You may also cancel your monthly service at any time without obligation, or change your date for a scheduled delivery before the products are shipped.</p>
        
      <h2>Payment and Order Terms</h2>

      <p>The amounts due and payable by you for any product that you purchase through the Services (including any applicable shipping charges and taxes) will be presented to you before you place your order.  If you place an order for any products via the Services, you agree (a) that Sant may charge your credit card for verification, pre-authorization and payment purposes, and (b) to bear any additional charges that your bank or other financial service provider may levy on you as well as any taxes or fees that may apply to your order.  We accept the following credit cards at this time: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB. We also accept PayPal. You’ll receive a confirmation email after we confirm the payment for your order and you will be charged once your order ships. Your order is not binding on Sant until accepted and confirmed by Sant.  We reserve the right to limit the order quantity on any product, to elongate the delivery timeline for any reason after the order has been placed, and/or refuse to ship product to any customer for any reason.  If you have any concerns or objections regarding charges, you agree to raise them with us first and you agree not to cancel or reject any credit card charges unless you have made a reasonable attempt at resolving the matter directly with Sant.  Sant reserves the right to not process or cancel your order in certain circumstances.  This may occur, for example, when the product or service you wish to purchase is out of stock or has been mispriced, we suspect the request is fraudulent, or in other circumstances Sant deems appropriate in its sole discretion.  Sant also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to take steps to verify your identity to process your order.  Sant will either not charge you or refund the charges for orders that we do not process or cancel.  Replacement of products and credits to your account for shipped merchandise claimed as not received are subject to our investigation, which may include postal-service notification. We will adjust your account at our discretion.</p>
       
      <p>In the event that a refund is issued, it can only be issued to the original form of payment.</p>
       
      <h2>Free Trials and Subsequent Monthly Service Payments</h2>

      <p>If you order a free trial and do not opt out within the allotted trial period of fourteen (14) days, you will be enrolled into a monthly delivery. </p>
      
      <p>If your payment method is declined, we will attempt to process your charge during the month until the transaction is approved. If we are unable to complete your charge, Sant may contact you directly to update your account information.  For your convenience, your credit or debit card information will be transmitted to and stored securely at our third-party processing provider in compliance with the Payment Card Industry standards.  </p>
       
      <h2>Title; Risk of Loss</h2>
      
      <p>The risk of loss and title for items purchased by you pass from Sant to you on shipment from Sant’s facility.  All shipments are governed in accordance to Sant’s standard shipping terms.  For shipments to you in the United States, we will ship the products FOB, Sant’s point of shipment.</p>
       
      <h2>Return Policies</h2>
      
      <p>We are committed to providing you with the highest quality products, and making your health and wellness our number one priority. For this reason, we maintain strict quality control standards and do not re-use or re-sell anything once it ships from our warehouse. This is purely to ensure your health safety! Once an order ships from our warehouse it is final sale. Please contact balance@idrinksant.com with any inquiries or issues regarding your order. We would be happy to connect with you there and find a solution.</p>
       
      <h2>Product & Service Availability</h2>
      
      <p>We are always striving to improve our products and the Services.  Therefore, we may revise or discontinue products at any time without notice or any liability. Prices and promotions are subject to change without notice.</p>
      
      <p>We do not warrant that information available via our Services is accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free.</p>
      
      <p>The Services may contain information regarding the availability of merchandise. This information can be used to estimate the likelihood that an item will be shipped immediately after you place your order. Unfortunately, Sant cannot guarantee that an item listed as "in stock" will actually ship right away, as inventory can change significantly from day-to-day. In rare cases, a product or service offering may be in stock when a customer places the order, and sold out by the time Sant attempts to process the order.</p>

      <h3><u>Agreement to Arbitrate</u></h3>
      
      <p>You and Sant agree that <i>any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek</i> injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an "<strong>IP Protection Action</strong>"). The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in Chicago, Illinois and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. <i>You acknowledge and agree that you and Sant </i><strong>are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding</strong>. Further, unless both you and Sant otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
       
      <h3><u>Arbitration Rules</u></h3>

      <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("<strong>AAA</strong>") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "<strong>AAA Rules</strong>") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at <%= link_to("www.adr.org/arb_med", "http://www.adr.org/arb_med") %>or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>
       
      <h3><u>Arbitration Process</u></h3>
      
      <p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <%= link_to("http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175",  "http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175") %> and a separate form for California residents at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
       
      <h3><u>Arbitration Location and Procedure</u></h3>
      
      <p>Unless you and Sant otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Sant submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
       
      <h3><u>Arbitrator’s Decision</u></h3>
      
      <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Sant will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
       
      <h3><u>Fees</u></h3>
      
      <p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Sant will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
       
      <h3><u>Changes</u></h3>
      
      <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Modification" section above, if Sant changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to <%= mail_to "balance@idrinksant.com" %>) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated" date above or in the date of Sant’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Sant in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>
